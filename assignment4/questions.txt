1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on videos?
    Many operative system developers for mobile phones disable autoplay on videos. This is to protect the user from
    using more data than wanted. Many users pay for the data they use. By ignoring autoplay they can choose to not
    watch videos that they do not want to use their data to watch
2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a devise with 320x568 resolution?
    @media only screen and (min-device-width:768) and (max-device-width: 1024px) {
        #logo{
            display: none;
        }
    }
    This will not do anything as the device width is smaller than min-device-width.
3. Mention som of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions like m.til.no for
    mobile and til.no for desktop?
    One advantage of having a single website is that it is less to maintain than several separate sites.
    Often all or more of the content and functionality is available on a responsive website compared to mobile dedicated
    sites.
    Responsive sites are often easier to find with a search engine than mobile sites.
