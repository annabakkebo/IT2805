1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed?
    Position:absolute places the object "relative" to it's parent.
    Position: fixed places the object relative to the viewpoint.
    For instance if you have a div item, and a div within that item that had position absolute. The absolute will then
    be placed on that image, while the fixed will be at the same point on the screen even when you're scrolling.
2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?
