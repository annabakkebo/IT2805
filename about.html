    <p>
        I'm Anna. I'm at my fourth year in my study to become a teacher in mathematics and
        informatics. With that I have experience in some languages. I'm mostly experienced in python and java. I also
        have some experience in PHP, HTML, CSS, latex and Maxima , and a tiny tiny bit in assembly (from the course
        TDT4160).
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of my coding experience comes from the courses I've had here at NTNU. Except for HTML, which I've learned
        from teaching it when having teaching practice. In the course IT1 in high school the pupils learn some basic
        HTML. So from teaching that I've also learned some HTML. Maxima I've learned through making math tasks for pupils
        in elementary school where Maxima was the language used to create the tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        My expectations for the course is that I will learn HTML and javascript. At least enough to be able to
        teach it confidently to pupils in high school. I also expect to learn some about the internett, and what I need
        to think about when creating a web page.

            The server in the client server architecture wait for requests from the clients and responds. For instance
            I as a client would request a web page and the server responds with the web page that I requested.
        </li>
        <li>
            The client request and recieve service and information from the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            An IP, short for internett protocol, is a unique numeric identifier that every computer on the Internett has.
            Through this we can distinguish the different computers connected to the internet, and with different IP
            adresses the client could be directed to the right web page. If the numbers weren't unique the client could
            be directed to the wrong web page. The protocol guarantees proper transmission of data.
        </li>
        <li>
            DNS, short for Domain Name Server, is what "translates" IP address' to homepage names. It is a server that
            connects the IP address to the homepage names.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Internett is a much broader term. The internet contains much more than that of WWW (the World Wide Web).
            The internet is a network of networks. The World Wide Web is a system of hypertext documents that is
            <u>accessed</u> over the Internet.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is a language that is used by WWW. HTML is a standard language
            that is used to describe how the web page is formatted. What the web page will look like.

            Why does inline style CSS override rules defined in style elements and external stylesheets?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When building the HTML file with CSS it always uses the last defined style. The inline style CSS is
                    then the last defined and then override the rules defined in the style element or external
                    stylesheets. This way you could use the defined style elements or external stylesheets as a general
                    template for the web page. When changing the style of spesific elements on the page the inline style
                    CSS would override.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Give a brief example of when to use ID (#id) and when to use classes (.class) in CSS.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ID is used when identifying <u>one</u> element, while classes can be used when identifying
                    <u>several</u> elements.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    RGBA, red-green-blue-alpha, defines what intensity of red, green or blue the color will have. In
                    addition it defines the opacity of the color as the alpha input. The red, green and blue inputs are
                    integers between 0 and 255 or percentage. Alpha is given as a number between 0 and 1. Where 0 is
                    transparent and 1 is visible. <br/>
                    We can express all colors with it.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Why do we include CSS files inside the head element and not inside the body element?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Because then the web page has the styles before starting to ''paint'' the web page. If it had been
                    inside the body element the web page would start to load the page, and then recognize the CSS file /
                    style element. It would then need to reload the page to implement the style.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            What CSS selector matches all the p elements inside the article element in the following HTML? <br/>
            <code>
                &lt;p&gt; This should not match &lt;/p&gt; <br/>
                &lt;article&gt; <br/>
                <div class="tab">
                    &lt;h2&gt;This should not match&lt;/h2&gt; <br/>
                    &lt;p&gt;This should match.&lt;/p&gt;<br/>
                    &lt;p&gt;This should also match.&lt;/p&gt;<br/>
                    &lt;p&gt;Do not forget about this one!&lt;/p&gt;<br/>
                </div>
                &lt;/article&gt;
