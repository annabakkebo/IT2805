1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in javascript?
    Because it is three equal signs. When there is three equal signs it checks if it is strictly equal. It doesn't
    convert types. Here 0.1+0.2 is a different type than 0.3
2. What does the method attribute on a form element decide?
    Tells the web browser how to send form data to a server
3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is changed to GET?
    It allows the browser to cache the results of the form submission, and it also allows the user to bookmark the page
    once the form has been submitted.
4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5 and/or Javascript?
    HTML5 and Javascript validation is considered as the client-side validation. Validation is often devided into two
    categories. Client-side validation and server-side validation. For best security and user experience it is best to
    use both types of validation. It is therefore considered bad practice to only use one of the types of validation.
5. When is it appropriate to use textarea over input?
    An input field is a one-line field, while textarea is a multi-line field that allows you to press enter. When the
    client will write a longer text it is good to use textarea. But if the user should only write a small text that is
    maximum one-line then it is good to use input.
